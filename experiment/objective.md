## Objective of the Scan Line Polygon Fill Algorithm Experiment

The objective of this experiment is to understand and demonstrate the steps of the Scan Line Polygon Fill algorithm. Given the vertices of a polygon, the algorithm fills the interior of the polygon in a 2D frame buffer. It processes the polygon by scanning each horizontal line (scan line) from top to bottom, determining where the edges of the polygon intersect with each scan line, and filling the pixels between these intersections to achieve a filled polygon.
