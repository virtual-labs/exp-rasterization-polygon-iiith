        "question": "1. In the Scanline Algorithm, what is the primary reason for sorting the edges in the Edge Table (ET) by their y-min value?",
        "answers": {
            "a": "To minimize the number of comparisons during the rasterization process.",
            "b": "To ensure edges are processed sequentially as the scanline moves downward.",
            "c": "To group edges that belong to the same polygon together.",
            "d": "To prioritize horizontal edges over vertical edges."
        },
        "correctAnswer": "b",
        "explanations": {
            "a": "Incorrect. Sorting by y-min does not directly minimize comparisons.",
            "b": "Correct. Sorting by y-min ensures edges are activated in the correct order as the scanline progresses.",
            "c": "Incorrect. Sorting does not group edges by polygon.",
            "d": "Incorrect. Horizontal edges are not prioritized over vertical edges."

        "question": "2. How does the Scanline Algorithm handle edges that intersect at the same scanline during rasterization?",
        "answers": {
            "a": "By processing edges from left to right based on their x-coordinates.",
            "b": "By discarding one of the edges to avoid overlap.",
            "c": "By merging the intersecting edges into a single edge.",
            "d": "By using the parity rule to determine which pixels to fill."
        },
        "correctAnswer": "d",
        "explanations": {
            "a": "Incorrect. Processing from left to right alone does not resolve intersection issues.",
            "b": "Incorrect. Edges are not discarded; they are managed using the parity rule.",
            "c": "Incorrect. Edges are not merged during intersections.",
            "d": "Correct. The parity rule ensures correct filling for edges intersecting at the same scanline."
        },

        {
        "question": "3. What is the significance of incrementing x-coordinates by 1/m during the scanline filling process?",
        "answers": {
            "a": "To calculate the slope of the polygon's edge.",
            "b": "To ensure the Active Edge Table (AET) remains sorted.",
            "c": "To track the intersection points of edges with the current scanline.",
            "d": "To adjust for changes in the polygon's color intensity."
        },
        "correctAnswer": "c",
        "explanations": {
            "a": "Incorrect. Incrementing x-coordinates by 1/m is not used for slope calculation.",
            "b": "Incorrect. Sorting the AET is handled separately, not through 1/m increments.",
            "c": "Correct. Incrementing by 1/m updates the intersection points for the next scanline.",
            "d": "Incorrect. Color intensity is not adjusted using 1/m increments."
