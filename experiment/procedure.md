### Procedure 


1. **Draw the Polygon**:
   - Click on the canvas to place the vertices and form a polygon. 
   - To complete the polygon, click near the first vertex to close the shape. 
   - The coordinates of each vertex will be displayed in the **Vertex Coordinates** section.

2. **Edit the Vertices**:
   - To adjust any vertex, hold the **left mouse button** on a vertex and drag it to the desired location.
   - Alternatively, click the **x** and **y** coordinates in the **Vertex Coordinates** section to manually edit the position of the vertex.

3. **Start the Fill Process**:
   - Once the polygon is complete, click the **Start Fill** button to begin the Scan Line Fill simulation.
   - The algorithm will begin calculating intersection points for each scan line.

4. **Control Iterations**:
   - Use the **Next Step** button to move to the next iteration of the algorithm. You can speed up the simulation by holding down the button.
   - Click the **Clear Canvas** button to reset the canvas and start over.
   
5. **Answer the Question**:
   - During the simulation, a question will appear in a modal. You must answer correctly to continue.
   - If the answer is incorrect, the modal will remain open, and you can retry until you answer correctly.

6. **Track Progress**:
   - The **Algorithm Progress** section on the right will display the current step of the simulation, showing details about active edges and intersection points.

7. **Repeat with New Vertices**:
   - After the experiment concludes, you can experiment again with new sets of vertices by drawing a new polygon on the canvas and starting the process again.
