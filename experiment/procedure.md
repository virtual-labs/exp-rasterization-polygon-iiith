1. Fix the size of the frame buffer (the default parameters are already filled in the input boxes) and then click on **Enter**.

   You can also proceed directly to the experiment using the default parameters of the size of frame buffer and the vertices of a polygon, by clicking on **Start Experiment with Default Values**.

2. Enter the vertices of the polygon in the input box.
  
	  Let, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4), (x5, y5)
  
    represent the vertices of the polygon in order, i.e., the 1st vertex is connected to the 2nd and 2nd to the 3rd and so on. The last vertex is connected to the 1st to complete the polygon.
  
    The default vertices are already filled in the input boxes. Once you have finalized the coordinates, you can click on **Start Experiment** to begin with the experiment.
  
    You can also go **Back** to change the values of the frame buffer.

3. Throughout the experiment, you can click on **Next Iteration** to go tothe next step of the algorithm and **Previous Iteration** to go to the previous step.

4. Once the experiment ends, you can again experiment with a new set of vertices of the polygon.
